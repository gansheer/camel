= Camel JBang Integration Tests

== Overview

This module is used to run integration tests for Camel JBang; CLI commands are executed in a containerized environment provided by link:../../../test-infra/camel-test-infra-cli[camel-test-infra-cli]

== Run tests

To run tests use the dedicated Maven profile `jbang-it-test` activated by the same property:

[source,bash]
----
mvn verify -Djbang-it-test
----

== Run tests locally

To run tests using a local Camel CLI process instead of a container, activate the `local-camel-cli-process` profile:

[source,bash]
----
mvn verify -Djbang-it-test -Dcamel-cli.instance.type=local-camel-cli-process
----

Tests tagged with `container-only` will be automatically excluded when this profile is active.

== Configuration

Camel CLI infra configuration is defined in link:../../../test-infra/camel-test-infra-cli/README.adoc[README.adoc]

- `jbang.it.assert.wait.timeout` : timeout in seconds for log assertions, default `60`
