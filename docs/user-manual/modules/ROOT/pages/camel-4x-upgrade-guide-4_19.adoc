== Upgrading Camel 4.18 to 4.19

=== camel-core

The WireTap EIP has removed the `pattern` option from its model (not in use) as wiretap always
uses `InOnly` pattern.

Removed 2 deprecated methods in Java DSL for `throttler` EIP.

=== camel-yaml-io / camel-xml-io

When dumping routes in YAML or XML format via `camel-yaml-io` or `camel-xml-io` then the structure of routes
and all the EIP options now respect the intended order in the model.

For example `id` is always first, and the following attributes are ordered so the most
commonly used at in the top. EIPs such as `circuitBreaker` now has `onFallback` last.

This order is also the same order that UI builders like Camel Karavan and Kaoto do as well.
