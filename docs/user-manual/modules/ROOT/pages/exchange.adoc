= Message Exchange

A request message and its corresponding reply or exception message is represented in Camel using the `Exchange` interface.
This interface provides an abstraction for this pattern of communication between systems.
The presence of a reply message is optional and depends on the xref:exchange-pattern.adoc[exchange pattern] used in the integration.
Thanks to this, Apache Camel can support different integration patterns such as:

* xref:components:eips:event-message.adoc[Event Messages]: messages that have only an inbound message
* xref:components:eips:requestReply-eip.adoc[Request and Reply]: messages that have an inbound and an outbound message.
