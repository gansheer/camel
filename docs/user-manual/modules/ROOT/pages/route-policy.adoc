= RoutePolicy

A route policy `org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicy` is used to control
route(s) at runtime. For example, you can use it to determine whether a
route should be running or not. However, the policies can support any
kind of use cases.

== How it works

You associate a route with a given `RoutePolicy` and then during
runtime Camel will invoke callbacks on this policy where you can
implement your custom logic. Camel provides a support class that can be used
to extend `org.apache.camel.support.RoutePolicySupport` and implement your logic.

There are these callbacks invoked:

* `onInit`
* `onRemove`
* `onStart`
* `onStop`
* `onSuspend`
* `onResume`
* `onExchangeBegin`
* `onExchangeDone`

See the Javadoc of the `org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicy` for more
details; and also the implementation of the
`org.apache.camel.throttling.ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` for a concrete
example.

Camel provides the following policies out of the box:

* `org.apache.camel.throttling.ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` - a throttling
based policy that automatically suspends/resumes route(s) based on metrics
from the current in flight exchanges. You can use this to dynamically
 throttle, e.g. a xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] consumer, to avoid it consuming too
fast.

* `org.apache.camel.throttling.ThrottlingExceptionRoutePolicy` - a throttling
based policy modeled after the circuit breaker. This policy will stop consuming
from an endpoint based on the type of exceptions that are thrown and the threshold setting.

* `org.apache.camel.impl.cluster.ClusteredRoutePolicy` - is the foundation for `camel-cluster`
which handles Camel routes to become active if a node becomes leader in a cluster.

Camel also provides an ability to schedule routes to
be activated, deactivated, suspended and/or resumed at certain times
during the day using a
xref:scheduledroutepolicy.adoc[ScheduledRoutePolicy] (offered via the
xref:components::quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component).

And route policy is also used as an implementation details for some of the Camel observability components.

== SuspendableService

If you want to dynamic suspend/resume routes, then it is advised to
use `SuspendableService` as it allows for fine-grained
suspend and resume operations.

== `ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`

The *`ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`* is triggered when an
xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] is complete, which means that it requires
at least one xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] to be complete before it
_works_.

The throttling in flight route policy has the following options:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Default |Description
|`scope` |`Route` |A scope for either `Route` or `Context` which defines if the current number of in flight exchanges is context based or for that particular route.
|`maxInflightExchanges` |`1000` |The maximum threshold when the throttling will start to suspend the route if the current number of in flight exchanges is higher than this value.
|`resumePercentOfMax` |`70` |A percentage `0..100` which defines when the throttling should resume again in case it has been suspended.
|`loggingLevel` |`INFO` |The logging level used for logging the throttling activity.
|`logger` |`ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` |The logger category.
|===

=== ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy compared to the Throttler EIP

The `ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` compared to
xref:components:eips:throttle-eip.adoc[Throttler] EIP is that it does *not* block during
throttling. Its throttling is approximate-based, meaning that
its coarser grained and not explicitly precise as the
xref:components:eips:throttle-eip.adoc[Throttler] EIP.

The xref:components:eips:throttle-eip.adoc[Throttler] EIP can
be much more accurate and only allow a specific number of messages being
passed per a given time unit. Also, the `ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`
is based its metrics on number of in flight exchanges whereas
xref:components:eips:throttle-eip.adoc[Throttler] EIP is based on number o
messages per time unit.

== ScheduledRoutePolicy

See xref:scheduledroutepolicy.adoc[Scheduled Route Policy] for scheduling based route policy.

== Using RoutePolicy in Camel routes

On the route(s) that should use one or more route policies, you configure this as shown below:

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
You configure the route policy as follows from Java DSL, using the `routePolicy` method:
+
[source,java]
----
RoutePolicy myPolicy = new MyRoutePolicy();

from("seda:foo")
    .routePolicy(myPolicy)
    .to("mock:result");
----

XML::
+
In XML you configure using the `routePolictRef` attribute on `<route>` as shown:
+
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myPolicy" class="com.mycompany.MyRoutePolicy"/>
   
<route routePolicyRef="myPolicy">
    <from uri="seda:foo"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

YAML::
+
In YAML you configure using the `routePolictRef` attribute on `route` node as shown:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    routePolicyRef: myPolicy
    from:
      uri: seda:foo
      steps:
        - to:
            uri: mock:result
----
====

You can configure one or more route policies (separated by comma), such as:

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("seda:foo")
    .routePolicy(myPolicy, myOtherPolicy)
    .to("mock:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myPolicy" class="com.mycompany.MyRoutePolicy"/>

<route routePolicyRef="myPolicy,myOtherPolicy">
    <from uri="seda:foo"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    routePolicyRef: myPolicy,myOtherPolicy
    from:
      uri: seda:foo
      steps:
        - to:
            uri: mock:result
----

== Using RoutePolicyFactory

If you want to use a route policy for every route, you can use
a `org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicyFactory` as a factory for creating new
`RoutePolicy` instance(s) for each route. This can be used when you
want to use the same kind of route policy for all.

With the factory, you only need to configure this once, and every route created will
have the policy assigned.

There is API on `CamelContext` to add a factory, as shown below

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...
context.addRoutePolicyFactory(new MyRoutePolicyFactory());
----

Spring Boot::
+
You can also mark your class with Spring Boot `@Component` for automatic dependency injection
+
[source,java]
----
@Component
public class MyRoutePolicyFactory() {

}
----

Quarkus::
+
You can also mark your class with Quarkus `@.ApplicationScoped` for automatic dependency injection
+
[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyRoutePolicyFactory() {

}
----


Spring XML::
+
And from Spring XML DSL you just define a `<bean>` with the factory, and Camel will automatically detect this factory:
+
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myRoutePolicyFactory" class="com.foo.MyRoutePolicyFactory"/>
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<bean name="myRoutePolicyFactory" type="com.foo.MyRoutePolicyFactory"/>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- beans:
    - name: myRoutePolicyFactory
      type: com.foo.MyRoutePolicyFactory
----
====

TIP: You can have as many route policy factories as you want, so if you have two factories,
you can just add  both of them.
