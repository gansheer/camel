= OnCompletion

Camel has this concept of a _Unit of Work_ that encompass the
Exchange. The unit of work among others supports
synchronization callbacks that are invoked when the
Exchange is complete. The callback API is defined in
`org.apache.camel.spi.Synchronization` and the extended synchronization
`org.apache.camel.spi.SynchronizationRouteAware` that have callbacks for
route events.

== UnitOfWork API

You can get hold of the `org.apache.camel.spi.UnitOfWork` from
`org.apache.camel.Exchange` with the method `getUnitOfWork()`.

== OnCompletion DSL

The OnCompletion EIP supports the following features:

* `scope`: context or route (takes precedence over global)
* `trigger`: always or only either if success or failed
* `onWhen`: predicate to only trigger if matching predicate
* `mode`: to define whether to run either before or after
route consumer writes response back to callee (if it is InOut) (default AfterConsumer)
* `parallelProcessing`: whether to run async or sync (use a thread pool or not) (default false)

The onCompletion supports running the completion task in either synchronous or asynchronous mode
(using a thread pool) and also whether to run before or after the route
consumer is done. The reason is to give more flexibility. For example to
specify to run synchronous and before the route consumer is done, which
allows to modify the exchange before the consumer writes back any
response to the callee. You can use this to for example add customer
headers, or send to a log to log the response message, etc.

=== onCompletion with route scope

The OnCompletion EIP allows you to add custom routes/processors when
the original Exchange is complete. Camel spins off a
copy of the Exchange and routes it in a separate
thread, similar to a Wire Tap. This allows the
original thread to continue while the onCompletion route is running
concurrently. We chose this model as we did not want the
onCompletion route to interfere with the original route.

=== Multiple onCompletions

You may define multiple onCompletions at both context and route level.

When you define route scoped onCompletions then any context scoped are disabled for that given route.

Java::

from("direct:start")
    .onCompletion()
        // this route is only invoked when the original route is complete as a kind
        // of completion callback
        .to("log:sync")
        .to("mock:sync")
    // must use end to denote the end of the onCompletion route
    .end()

    <!-- this callback is always triggered even if the exchange failed -->

        <to uri="log:sync"/>
        <to uri="mock:sync"/>
    </onCompletion>
    <process ref="myProcessor"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    from:
      uri: direct:start
      steps:
        - onCompletion:
            steps:
              - to:
                  uri: log:sync
              - to:

By default, the OnCompletion EIP will always be triggered when the
Exchange is complete. In case you only want to trigger if the exchange
completed successfully or only for failures, then this can be specified via
`onCompleteOnly` or `onFailureOnly` as shown below:

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    // here we qualify onCompletion to only invoke when the exchange failed (exception or FAULT body)
    .onCompletion().onFailureOnly()
        .to("log:sync")
        .to("mock:syncFail")
    // must use end to denote the end of the onCompletion route
    .end()    
    .onCompletion().onCompleteOnly()
        .to("log:sync")
        .to("mock:syncOK")
    .end()
    // here the original route continues
    .process(new MyProcessor())
    .to("mock:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <!-- this onCompletion block will only be executed when the exchange is done being routed -->
    <!-- this callback is only triggered when the exchange failed, as we have onFailureOnly=true -->
    <onCompletion onFailureOnly="true">
        <to uri="log:sync"/>
        <to uri="mock:sync"/>
    </onCompletion>
    <process ref="myProcessor"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    from:
      uri: direct:start
      steps:
        - onCompletion:
            onFailureOnly: "true"
            steps:
              - to:
                  uri: log:sync
              - to:
                  uri: mock:sync
        - process:
            ref: myProcessor
        - to:
            uri: mock:result
----
====

You can identify if the Exchange is an
OnCompletion Exchange as Camel will add the
property `Exchange.ON_COMPLETION` with a boolean value of `true`.

=== onCompletion with global level

This works just like the route level except from the fact that they are
defined globally. An example below:

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
// define a global on completion that is invoked when the exchange is done being routed
onCompletion().to("log:global").to("mock:sync");
 
from("direct:start")
    .process(new MyProcessor())
    .to("mock:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<!-- this is a global onCompletion route that is invoked when any exchange is done being routed
     as a kind of after callback -->
<onCompletion>
    <to uri="log:global"/>
    <to uri="mock:sync"/>
</onCompletion>
 
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <process ref="myProcessor"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- onCompletion:
    steps:
      - to:
          uri: log:global
      - to:
          uri: mock:sync
- route:
    from:
      uri: direct:start
      steps:
        - process:
            ref: myProcessor
        - to:
            uri: mock:result
----
====

IMPORTANT: If an `onCompletion` is defined in a route, it overrides *all* global
scoped, and thus it is only the route scoped that is used. The globally
scoped are not in use.

=== Using onCompletion with onWhen predicate

As other DSL in Camel you can attach a predicate to
the `onCompletion`, so it only triggers in certain conditions, when the
predicate matches. For example to only trigger if the message body contains the word
_Hello_ we can do like:

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .onCompletion().onWhen(body().contains("Hello"))
        // this route is only invoked when the original route is done being routed
        // and the onWhen predicate is true
        .to("log:sync")
        .to("mock:sync")
    // must use end to denote the end of the onCompletion route
    .end()
    // here the original route continues
    .to("log:original")
    .to("mock:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <onCompletion>
        <onWhen>
            <simple>${body} contains 'Hello'</simple>
        </onWhen>
        <to uri="log:sync"/>
        <to uri="mock:sync"/>
    </onCompletion>
    <to uri="log:original"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    from:
      uri: direct:start
      steps:
        - onCompletion:
            steps:
              - onWhen:
                  expression:
                    simple:
                      expression: "${body} contains 'Hello'"
              - to:
                  uri: log:sync
              - to:
                  uri: mock:sync
        - to:
            uri: log:original
        - to:
            uri: mock:result

== Using onCompletion with or without thread pool

To use a thread pool then either set a `executorService` or set
`parallelProcessing` to true.

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
onCompletion().parallelProcessing()
    .to("mock:before")
    .delay(1000)
    .setBody(simple("OnComplete:${body}"));
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<onCompletion parallelProcessing="true">
  <to uri="mock:before"/>
  <delay><constant>1000</constant></delay>
  <setBody><simple>OnComplete:${body}</simple></setBody>
</onCompletion>
----
+
You can also refer to a specific thread pool
to be used, using the `executorServiceRef` option
+
[source,xml]
----
<onCompletion executorServiceRef="myThreadPool">
  <to uri="mock:before"/>
  <delay><constant>1000</constant></delay>
  <setBody><simple>OnComplete:${body}</simple></setBody>
</onCompletion>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- onCompletion:
    parallelProcessing: "true"
    steps:
      - to:
          uri: mock:before
      - delay:
          expression:
            constant:
              expression: 1000
      - setBody:
          expression:
            simple:
              expression: "OnComplete:${body}"
----

            constant:
              expression: 1000
      - setBody:
          expression:
            simple:
              expression: "OnComplete:${body}"

=== OnCompletion consumer modes

OnCompletion supports two modes that affect the route consumer:

* `AfterConsumer` - Default mode which runs after the consumer is done
* `BeforeConsumer` - Runs before the consumer is done, and before the
consumer writes back response to the callee

The AfterConsumer mode is the default mode which is the same behavior as
in older Camel releases.

The new BeforeConsumer mode is used to run `onCompletion` before the
consumer writes its response back to the callee (if in InOut mode). This
allows the `onCompletion` to modify the Exchange, such as adding special
headers, or to log the Exchange as a response logger etc.

For example to always add a "created by" header you
use `modeBeforeConsumer()` as shown below:

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
.onCompletion().modeBeforeConsumer()
    .setHeader("createdBy", constant("Someone"))
.end()
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<onCompletion mode="BeforeConsumer">
  <setHeader name="createdBy">
    <constant>Someone</constant>
  </setHeader>
</onCompletion>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- onCompletion:
    mode: BeforeConsumer
    steps:
      - setHeader:
          name: createdBy
          expression:
            constant:
              expression: Someone
